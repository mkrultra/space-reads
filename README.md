* Modern Engineering for Design of Liquid Propellant Rocket Engines (Progress in Astronautics and Aeronautics) (Dieter K. Huzel, David H. Huang) - A textbook, so find a PDF or used copy (for sure), but an EXCELLENT textbook. If you look up "Design of...", you'll find the authors' original documentation from 1967 for NASA, which is freely available as a PDF.
